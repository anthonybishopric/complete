## What is this?

I wanted to do a toy project in Go as well as build something that simulated evolution.

## How do I run it?

	> go run *.go

When you run the program you get an interactive prompt to run the ecosystem.

## What did I learn?

* It's really hard to simulate evolution. The attributes of life I selected to be variable are too coarse and high-level. I feel like I'd need to reimplement fundamental chemistry to get the level of self-hosting i want
* Channels are useful for simulating generators
* All about the sort.Interface
* Typed fucntions are very useful
* More general useful knowledge about slices
